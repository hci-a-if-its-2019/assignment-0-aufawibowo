### 1. Stockbit.com
![stockbit](img/stockbit.jpg "stockbit")
**Description:** Stockbit is an investment community in Indonesia.Stockbit provides space for investors and traders to share ideas, news and other financial information in real time. Users can create profiles and follow certain stocks or favorite investors to get valuable information and exchange ideas. The main feature of Stockbit is "stream" consisting of ideas, stock charts, links and other financial data. Stockbit uses the sign "$" before the stock code as a tagging idea to make it easier for users to find information about certain individual stocks. The Stockbit platform is also integrated with other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, making it easy to share ideas in the Stockbit to Twitter accounts and Facebook users. Stockbit is designed with focused features with the behavior of investors and traders so that it will be more useful as an investment-specific social media.

**Opinion:** Stockbit has a good quality UI for user who want to give idea and scroll the timeline. Twitter for investors, basically. But, there is some flaw. For user who want to try stock trading simulation, I notice some 'imperfection' here. 

These are basic things commonly investors do to their portofolio
  - Buy/Sell order
  - Check Portofolio

##### Buy/Sell Order
It's hard at first to figure out how to place an order to buy/sell stock. But, *intuitively* we would go to search bar and type the stock we want to search to do that. And tada!
